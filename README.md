# On-Time-Flight-Performance-Prediction

# 1. Project Headlines
This project idea cames out from occuring flight delays among United States Airline Industries. Being able to predict flight delays ahead  of departure and arrival time can potentially reduce the last-minute change of schedules. It can also help airlines make the necessary preparations in advance to ensure that they make the journey for their passengers as smooth as possible.

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Gather the primary dataset (Airline performance 2019-2021) and secondary datasets (passenger, airline employment, and covid data)
2. Remove the junk values and missing data on several columns. Then try to correlate the covid data with the other data to examine the impact of covid on flight performance and passenger quantity
3. Visualize the correlation with tableau

# 4. Machine Learning Modeling
Perform ML models for these data (in my case : Random forest, Linear regression, and xgboost)
