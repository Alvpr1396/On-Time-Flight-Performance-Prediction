# On-Time-Flight-Performance-Prediction

# 1. Project Headlines
This project idea cames out from occuring flight delays among United States Airline Industries. Being able to predict flight delays ahead  of departure and arrival time can potentially reduce the last-minute change of schedules. It can also help airlines make the necessary preparations in advance to ensure that they make the journey for their passengers as smooth as possible.
